Description
The "Guess Number" game is a simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

Features
The game generates a random number within a specified range.
The player is prompted to guess the number.
The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The game keeps track of the number of attempts made by the player.
After guessing the correct number, the game displays the number of attempts it took the player to guess correctly.
How to Play
Run the program.
The game will prompt you to enter the range within which you want to guess the number (e.g., from 1 to 100).
Once the range is set, the game will generate a random number within that range.
You will be prompted to enter your guess.
After each guess, the game will inform you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.
Once you've guessed the number correctly, the game will display the number of attempts it took you to guess correctly.
